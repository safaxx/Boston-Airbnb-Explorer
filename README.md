# Boston-Airbnb-Explorer

The goal of the project is to understand the Boston Airbnb Market and asses the potential value of the property by looking at different aspects 
from the data set.
The Airbnb data can be found [here](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/)

In this project, data importing and cleaning skills are applied to uncover insights about the Airbnb market in Boston City.
For cleaning and manupiating the data, I've used Python in Jupyter notebook. For gathereing insights on the now cleaned data SQL Server is used.
And Power BI is used to create Dashboard.
The Power BI Dashboard can be accessed [here](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiZWE1MGNmNWEtMTU4ZS00YTkzLTkxMzAtMWY3MDdiNDVlNjhhIiwidCI6ImRmZTk4MGE5LTYwYTAtNDJmNS04OTQyLWQxMzAzYjE5MTAwZCJ9&pageName=ReportSection)`
